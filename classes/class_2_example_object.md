# The Benam Lab

## Attributes
```
staff = ["Dr. Mary S", "Dr. Simon B", "Bill Jr."]
description = "The Benam lab researches the interaction of DNA and phylogeny."
is_open_access = true
equipment = ["microscope", "flask", "nanodrop"]
```

## Methods
list_equipment: `puts ["microscope", "flask", "nanodrop"]`
update_description: `description = "The Benam lab specializes in highly complex DNA interactions."`
hire_personnel: `staff = ["Dr. Mary S", "Dr. Simon B", "Bill Jr.", "Mr. G"]`
close_lab: `is_open_access = false`
**Note: in practice, we would have the list_equipment method would be implemented as `puts equipment` rather than explicitly listing the array contents.**
